ASSUMPTION OF RISK</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c2">You accept and acknowledge each of the following:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile.

Oni Squad is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">C. The App does not store, send, or receive Onis or related digital assets. This is because Onis exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App&rsquo;s supporting blockchain on the Ethereum, Polygon, or future applicable blockchain network. Any transfer of Onis or Oni-branded digital assets occurs only on the Ethereum or Polygon network.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">D.

The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Oni ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Onis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">G.
